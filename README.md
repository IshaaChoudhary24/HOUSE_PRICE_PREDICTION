The Bangalore House Price Prediction project uses machine learning algorithms to estimate property prices based on various features like location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and amenities. The dataset includes real estate listings with price trends across different areas of Bangalore. Data cleaning, feature selection, and exploratory data analysis are performed to improve model accuracy. Algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest are commonly used. The model helps buyers, sellers, and investors make informed decisions about property pricing
